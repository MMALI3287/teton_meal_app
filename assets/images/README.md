# Votes Page Image Assets

This directory contains placeholder files for the food images and illustrations that should be displayed in the votes page to match the Figma design.

## Required Images

To complete the Figma design implementation, replace these placeholder files with actual images:

### Food Images
- `egg.png` - Image of Egg Khichuri dish
- `beef.png` - Image of Beef & Rice dish  
- `chicken.png` - Image of Chicken Khichuri dish

These should be circular crop-ready images that will be displayed in 38x38 circular containers.

### Illustration
- `man_confused_lunch.png` - Illustration of a confused person choosing between food options
  - Should match the Figma design illustration
  - Recommended size: 177x118 pixels
  - Should be a PNG with transparent background if possible

## Image Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparent backgrounds preferred
- Size: Optimize for mobile display
- Quality: High enough for crisp display on various screen densities
- Style: Should match the overall design aesthetic of the app

## Figma Assets

The exact images and illustrations can be extracted from the Figma design file at:

## Usage

Once the actual images are added, the votes page will display:
- Food images for each menu option
- Progress bars showing voting percentages  
- The confused person illustration
- Proper layout matching the Figma design exactly

The current implementation handles image loading errors gracefully by falling back to icon representations.
