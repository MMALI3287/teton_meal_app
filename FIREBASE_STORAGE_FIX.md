# Firebase Storage Fix for Teton Meal App

This document explains the changes made to fix the "Firebase Storage no object found" error when uploading profile images.

## Changes Made

1. **Explicit Firebase Storage Initialization**
   - Added explicit initialization of Firebase Storage in `main.dart`
   - Added logging of the Storage bucket name for debugging

2. **Enhanced StorageService**
   - Improved error handling in the StorageService class
   - Added detailed debug logs for file existence, size, and upload progress
   - Added specific error classification for common Firebase Storage errors

3. **Improved Upload Process**
   - Enhanced error handling in the `_uploadImageToFirebase` method
   - Added additional debug logs to track the upload process
   - Better file validation before upload

4. **Testing Utilities**
   - Added `FirebaseStorageTest` utility class to test Firebase Storage connectivity
   - Added a "Test Storage" button on the registration screen (visible in debug mode only)

5. **Firebase Storage Rules Documentation**
   - Created `FIREBASE_STORAGE_RULES.md` with instructions for configuring Storage rules

## How to Use

1. **Test Storage Connection**
   - In debug mode, use the "Test Storage" button on the registration screen
   - Check the console logs for detailed information about the test

2. **Configure Firebase Storage Rules**
   - Follow instructions in `FIREBASE_STORAGE_RULES.md` to update your Storage rules
   - Make sure authenticated users have permission to write to the `profile_images` folder

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "No object found at location"

This typically means one of:
- The Firebase Storage path doesn't exist
- The app doesn't have permission to access that path

**Solution:**
1. Verify Firebase Storage rules allow access to the path
2. Make sure the path exists (the test button can create the folder if missing)
3. Check that Firebase Storage is properly initialized

### Issue: Upload starts but fails to complete

**Solution:**
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify the image file is not too large (we're already compressing images)
3. Look for errors in the debug logs

### Issue: Can't get download URL after upload

**Solution:**
1. Verify Firebase Storage rules allow read access to the uploaded file
2. Check if the upload completed successfully before requesting the URL

## Debugging Tips

1. Enable debug mode to see detailed logs
2. Use the "Test Storage" button to verify Firebase Storage connectivity
3. Check Firebase Console to see if files are actually being uploaded
4. Verify the profile_images folder exists in your Firebase Storage
